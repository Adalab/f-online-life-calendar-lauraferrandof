# Life calendar

This is a web app to register your daily mood: happy :) or sad :(.

It's my first attempt to create an app using [Angular](https://angular.io/), but I have only learned a few basics so it's not finished, and for the moment the user can only navigate between the editor and the calendar views. I hope I will be able to continue learning to use this framework and working on this project soon!

## How to use this repo

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.6. In order to make it work, first you need to have a package manager installed, such as npm in [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/). Then you'll need to install the CLI globally:

`$ npm install -g @angular/cli`

Now you can:

1. Clone the repo.
2. Install the dependencies by running `$ npm install`.
3. In the project directory, type `$ ng serve -o` to run the app in the development mode.
4. Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser.
5. Start coding! :)

To get more help on the Angular CLI commands check out the [Angular CLI command reference documentation](https://angular.io/cli)!
